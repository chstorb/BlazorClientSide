## This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions
#name: CI
# A. Define the name for this action
name: DeployToGitHubPages

# B. Define a environment variable to indicate the publish location from the Blazor WebAssembly App
env:
  PUBLISH_DIR: examples/Howler.Blazor-WASM-AudioPlayer/bin/Release/netstandard2.1/publish/wwwroot

## Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on push or pull request
## events but only for the master branch
#on:
#  push:
#    branches: [ master ]
#  pull_request:
#    branches: [ master ]

# C. Controls when the action will run, in this case only checkins on master branch
on:
  push:
    branches: [ master ]

## A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
#jobs:
#  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
#  build:
#    # The type of runner that the job will run on
#    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
#
#    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
#    steps:
#      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
#      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
#
#      # Runs a single command using the runners shell
#      - name: Run a one-line script
#        run: echo Hello, world!
#
#      # Runs a set of commands using the runners shell
#      - name: Run a multi-line script
#        run: |
#          echo Add other actions to build,
#          echo test, and deploy your project.

    # E. Build and Publish the Blazor WebAssembly App
    - name: Publish app
